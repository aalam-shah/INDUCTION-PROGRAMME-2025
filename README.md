## DAY 1 (July 30,2025)
On this day, we were very excited about our college. We went to the college's Gurudwara Sahib, where we saw the Kirtani Jatha. They recited hymns, and we all listened with deep spiritual focus. After the completion of the kirtan, we received deg.

Then we moved toward the main gate and headed to the college auditorium. There, we received a warm welcome and a welcome kit from the volunteers. We saw the front view of our college, which looked classy and pristine.
We entered the auditorium and sat in our seats according to our branches. The first lecture was delivered by Dr. Harpreet Kaur (HoD Ma’am), and we listened attentively. Then, the chief guest the Chief Minister of the Municipal Corporation came on stage and gave us a valuable and inspiring speech about living a meaningful life.
After the session, we left the auditorium, and the volunteers guided us to different labs. We saw how real-life engineering works, and it gave us hands-on exposure.Laterally this day was my memorable.


## DAY 2 ( Aug 01,2025)
On this day, we moved to the auditorium as per our lecture schedule. Our respected HoD ma’am led us in a prayer to the Almighty for a good beginning and a bright future. We all closed our eyes and recited God's name together. After the prayer, she shared important college instructions and guidelines.
