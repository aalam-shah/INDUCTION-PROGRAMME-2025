After it's completion we ate such a food called deg. Then we moved to out gate and went to college's auditorium. Where we got warm welcome and welcome kit by volunteers. We saw our college front which looks classy and pristine. We went auditorium and sit to our places with branch wise. The 1st lecture had given by Dr. Harpreet Kaur (HoD) mam and we listened carefully. Then the main guest chief minister of municipal corporation went to stage and gave us valueable lecture. He inspired us for well life. Then we left the auditorium and our volunteers guided us. They brought us to different different labs and we saw how the actual things works in engineering. Such it was my one of the best experience which conduct me to practical engineering. We all were full of joy and came back to our homes.
